Catalogue

This application is an online clothes retailer that allows customers to:
browse a catalogue of clothing,
add items to a wishlist for later use, and add items to a shopping cart

The prioritised list of user stories is as follows:
1. As a Customer I can view the products and their category, price and availability information. 2. As a Customer I can add a product to my shopping cart.
3. As a Customer I can remove a product from my shopping cart.
4. As a Customer I can view the total price for the products in my shopping cart.
5. As a Customer I am unable to add Out of Stock products to the shopping cart. 6. As a Customer I can add a product to my wishlist.
7. As a Customer I can remove a product from my wishlist.
8. As a Customer I can move a product from my wishlist to the shopping cart.
