Catalogue

Your client is an online clothes retailer. You have been asked by the client to build a mobile app that allows the customer to:
browse a catalogue of clothing,
add items to a wishlist for later use, and add items to a shopping cart

The prioritised list of user stories is as follows:
1. As a Customer I can view the products and their category, price and availability information. 2. As a Customer I can add a product to my shopping cart.
3. As a Customer I can remove a product from my shopping cart.
4. As a Customer I can view the total price for the products in my shopping cart.
5. As a Customer I am unable to add Out of Stock products to the shopping cart. 6. As a Customer I can add a product to my wishlist.
7. As a Customer I can remove a product from my wishlist.
8. As a Customer I can move a product from my wishlist to the shopping cart.

Usage

From the "Home" screen there is a list of items. Each item can be added to the cart (add to cart) or to the wishList(add to wishlist).  
After adding to cart all the items selected, press the button "Cart" in the navigation bar.
In the "Cart" screen there are all the items previously selected, and the total price of all the items added together. 
Press back button. Select items to add to wishlist. After adding the items press "WishList" button. 
The items in "WishList" can be added to the "Cart" by selecting the button "add to cart".

If either "Cart" screen or "WishList" screen are accedded without adding any items, the message "Your cart is empty!" or "your wishlist is empty" are displayed.
